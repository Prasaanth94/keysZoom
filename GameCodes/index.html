      <h1 id="gameTitle">KeysZoom</h1>
      <p id="description">
        KeyZoom draws inspiration from beloved games of the 2000s, where its primary aim is to recreate the joy and friendly 
        competition among friends. The essence of the game lies in determining who reigns supreme by achieving the highest score.
         How is this accomplished? Through the simple action of pressing a designated set of keys. Sounds straightforward, doesn't it? 
         Yet, it's far from easy. KeyZoom challenges your agility and precision, putting your reaction speed and hand-eye coordination to the test.
